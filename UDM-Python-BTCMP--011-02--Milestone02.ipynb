    "\n",
    "- **Overview**: A classic card game featuring a computer dealer and a human player.\n",
    "- **Deck**: Utilizes a standard deck of 52 cards represented in Python.\n",
    "- **Bankroll**: The player starts with a specified bankroll.\n",
    "- **Betting**: The player places a bet before the game begins.\n",
    "- **Initial Deal**: The player receives two cards face up; the dealer shows one card face up and one face down.\n",
    "- **Objective**: The player's goal is to get closer to 21 than the dealer without exceeding it.\n",
    "- **Gameplay Options**:\n",
    "  - **Hit**: The player can choose to receive another card.\n",
    "  - **Stay**: The player can choose to stop receiving cards.\n",
    "- **Rules**: \n",
    "  - Insurance, split, and double down options are not implemented.\n",
    "- **Dealer's Turn**: After the player's turn, the dealer continues to hit until they win or bust (exceed 21).\n",
    "- **End of Game Scenarios**:\n",
    "  - The player busts, resulting in a win for the dealer, who collects the player's bet.\n",
    "  - The dealer's total exceeds the player's without busting, resulting in a win for the dealer.\n",
    "  - The dealer busts, leading to a win for the player, who doubles their bet and adds it to their bankroll.\n",
    "- **Card Values**:\n",
    "  - Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are valued at 10.\n",
    "  - Aces can be valued at 1 or 11, depending on which is more advantageous."

    "    - Loop until the dealer has a better hand or busts:\n",
    "        - Compare the dealer's sum against the player's.\n",
    "        - If the dealer's sum is not better, continue to hit.\n",
